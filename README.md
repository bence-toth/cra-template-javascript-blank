# cra-template-javascript-blank

This is a JavaScript template for [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) which is entirely blank.

No spinning logo, no unnecessary boilerplate code.

In addition to [the official JavaScript template](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/tree/main/packages/cra-template), the following dependencies are included by default:

- [classnames](https://www.npmjs.com/package/classnames)
- [react-router-dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-router-dom)

To use this template, add `--template javascript-blank` when creating a new app.

For example:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app --template javascript-blank

# or

yarn create react-app my-app --template javascript-blank
```
